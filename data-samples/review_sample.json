I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated\/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4\/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant\/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.","date":"2015-03-05 03:37:54"}

That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late).

The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup\/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad\/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.","date":"2016-05-31 02:14:54"}

I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop.

The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. \n\nIt is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it.

Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents\/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...\n- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. \n- Clean the bathroom!!\n\nWill probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.","date":"2017-01-02 04:12:17"}

Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.\n\nTheir menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients.

Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. \n\nBut over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  \n\nThe Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. \n\nThe fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries\n\nThe onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). \n\nSpanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good\n\nBaklava - VERY GOOD! \n\nSignature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!\n\nThe (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. \n\nOverall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.","date":"2012-03-30 20:57:29"}

My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.

Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.\n\nI got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.","date":"2014-11-12 12:41:29"}

It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200\/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.","date":"2013-08-03 16:26:48"}

They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w\/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!\n\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea.

Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.","date":"2016-11-22 05:02:55"}

But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.\n\nMy friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said \"look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days.\" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.\n\nAllison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.\n\nOne of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve???

I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days, but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect, but pretty damn close), but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.

This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.\n\n\n*** Final note:\nNot about this location but where I returned my car.\n\n\"Return Location Address and Phone Number :\nPORT JEFFERSON STATION\n320 ROUTE 112\nPORT JEFFERSON STATION, NY 11776-1010\nTel.: (631) 474-2100\"\n\nThis address is totally WRONG!!!

I will never get tired of raving about our experience.  We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding.  Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't change a thing!\n\nThe hotel property is absolutely charming.  The décor in the lobby is beautiful, eclectic, and very welcoming.  The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties.  The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!\n\nThe rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!\n\nThe brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!  The service at the new coffee\/dessert café was wonderful!  The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future! \n\nFinally, the best part of all is the management and team at the Hollander.  Nick and Will treated us like their own family.  They went above and beyond to ensure that each of our guests felt like they were at home and comfortable.  Zach at the front desk was so friendly and patient with me as I called checking on our room block.  The entire team was just a delight and so very accommodating.  They take great pride in ensuring that every guest has a wonderful experience.  We just adore everyone there!

The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.\n\nAnother taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.

I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.\n\nAll around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.

We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil, but it looked like that would have been a better choice.","date":"2013-03-18 21:33:19"}

I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.

Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.

In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on.","date":"2013-11-14 10:28:34"}

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \n\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\n\nIt was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \n\nAfter getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \n\nAfter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \n\nOnce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \n\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\n\nIn summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. \n\nI really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.","date":"2017-09-09 00:09:15"}

Again, multiple choices for the three courses, but I chose to start with the crisp peas\/ham\/garlic risotto [balls].

Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  \n\nTahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.\n\nI love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one\n\nMy husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.\n\nI was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.\n\nOur service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  \n\nMy eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.","date":"2013-08-03 15:34:15"}

(The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!\n\nWe also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)\n\nThe ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!\n\nBy the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting.

I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.\n Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said \"This is how we do it here.\" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere.\nI will not be returning to this establishment.\n\nWorst yet.","date":"2012-12-04 02:33:18"}

For my food, I had the po'boy shrimp and was underwhelmed, there was a hardy serving of shrimp but there was minimal lettuce or sauce and the fries were weak, many soggy.

I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.\n\nThe Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed\/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.\nThere wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.\n\nOverall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes. I forgot to mention how quiet** this place is. I loved it. I felt as if no one was there except me. Very quiet* which worked for me on Sunday bc I had lots of studying to do and two TV's to watch The Walking Dead on. Lol!  I would most definitely stay here again. Very spacious and updated.

I made a mistake in purchasing a vehicle that is out of my budget on a Friday afternoon.  By Sunday after review of my budget I realized I was unable to afford the car.  I called the salesman and tried to explain my situation at 11:30am.  He stated he would speak with his manager and call me back.  At 3:30 after no return call, I called him again, no answer. I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.  I received a call from the bank stating the loan had NOT been funded and they would be unable to okay the loan.  I have left numerous messages with the dealership and have yet to receive a callback.  I contacted an attorney and per his review I again called the dealership and asked for a time to return the vehicle and take back my trade.  Still no response!

Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.\n\nI decided to get the one-meat plate with \"wet\" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,\n\nWe both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze. I will definitely return to LA Smokehouse and I'll be adding it to my \"BBQ Favorites\" list for future reference.","date":"2016-11-21 20:04:45"}

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. \n\nThe layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. \n\nThough they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. \n\nOur group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. \n\nAll the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. \n\nWe settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch. No matter the size of my group, I will definitely be returning!","date":"2010-05-14 22:21:21"}

These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal. \nSecond, my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm.\nLastly, the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!\n\nGoodbye Silver mine!","date":"2015-05-12 22:44:02"}

Lamb, Chicken, Adana, and gyro kebab meats, so tender and expertly spiced and grilled, along with a shepherds salad, grilled half tomatoes, rice, and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender, juicy, and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup, which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees, sides, salad bar, and drinks, and you have to try the rice pudding.

Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.\n\nI purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. \n\nAfter sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \"finished car\" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. \n\nAfter all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \"I don't know\" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \"I don't know\". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \"serviced\". \n\nInvest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.","date":"2014-05-08 13:41:39"}

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.","date":"2013-11-14 01:23:03"}

Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\n\nAnd now for a full review:\n\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\n\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\n\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\n\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\n\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\n\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \n\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \n\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\n\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.","date":"2012-07-16 17:27:36"}

I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. \n\nOur server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. \n\nThe crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus.

I visited Stitch-It in June 2013\n\nIn brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.\n\nComplete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  \n\nStitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor\/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!\"  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  \n\nI contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.","date":"2014-05-26 17:53:55"}

However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.\n\nThe service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager\/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \n\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \n\nI am a fan!

There were at least 10 other bachelorette groups there and a few 50th birthday parties too. Their signature cocktails are great but overpriced in my opinion.

Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. \n\nI always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very \ngood. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.\n\nSeasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. \n\nThe service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. \n\nI can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as \"the best food item\" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. \n\nI look forward to many more visits with friends at this location.

She sent me a quote, staying within my budget, noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet, boutonniere, and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.\n\nOn the wedding day, Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding.

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\nBut whats this? \nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\n\nNo.\nNo, it can't be! \nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\n\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\nWhy am I here?\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\n\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \n\nZaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\n \nI've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.\n\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\n\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\n\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \n\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\n\nP.S.\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.","date":"2010-08-20 19:16:04"}

I was not disappointed!\nWe started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).\nWe were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.\nThe service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1\/2 that size for twice that price)...\nThe ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!","date":"2016-03-07 01:32:03"}

We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \n\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \n\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \n\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \n\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!","date":"2018-04-15 13:21:32"}

This would have been fine because a lot of times the \"run down\" places have the best \"authentic food,\" but this was not the case at Dinardo's.  At Dinardo's you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low.    Our server hated his life and made snarky, mean comments throughout our time there which, though entertaining, was kind of unwelcome and unpleasant.  My friend had the mussels which were puny and in an unimpressive sauce--unimpressive being the general adjective I would use to describe any given dish my party ordered.  I had a soup which was extremely salty and bland beyond that and the broiled flounder and \"seafood imperial\" dishes were OK at best. \n\nI'd say if you're looking for good seafood you'd be better off at any BYOB; little fish, audrey claire, ANYWHERE but Dinardo's.

We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  \n\nFor our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. \n\nShortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.\n\nFor our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.\n\n I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.\n\nGreat first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.\n\nWe'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.","date":"2017-05-26 01:02:46"}

We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5\/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue.

I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see \"how they do things\" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.\n\nI did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn't be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn't need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.\n\nWe started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I've had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don't have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. \n\nWe then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it's too hot for me, I don't taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn't be overcooked, and they weren't. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?\n\nWe then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).\n\nLike Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the 'orange-y' sauce like other pad thai's, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. \n\nMy dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don't live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.\n\nI did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. \n\nI didn't get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn't think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.","date":"2013-06-24 09:58:07"}

No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.\n\nThis store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's \"Whitewashed.\"  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?\n\nOne great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.\n\nThe extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!\n\nThe later 80s quote, \"K-Mart sucks\", remains as true as ever and who knows, you may even bump into someone who still dresses from that Tom Cruise era who cares about male panty line. One never knows?","date":"2012-03-31 12:55:01"}

We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better. Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty. \n\nThe other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy. \n\nI am willing to come back to Nippon Tei, but I have to say I already have my other favorites.

Buying the tickets was a breeze, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a \"closed-system\" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.

Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa.

I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I took my parents out to dinner.  I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home.

So, the dish I had picked out online wasn't available and I ordered a burger instead.  The server seemed to have a very hard time understanding my burger and suggested that modifications couldn't be made?

I visited on 3\/8\/13 and got their \"Mini Manicure\"- it's only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3\/18\/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I'm not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.\n\nI was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner\/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.\n\nI'm conflicted, but I don't know that I'll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn't gel- because I can't even take the polish off myself.  So I'm forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it's Monday afternoon....","date":"2013-03-18 20:32:27"}

With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.\n\nThey took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.\n\nVideo games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.\n\nMore TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).\n\nA word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.\n\nTypically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.\n\nThe food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. \n\nThose staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.\n\nHappy Hour 2pm - 6pm Monday -  Friday; Late Happy Hour 10pm - close Monday - Thursday.  Happy Hour all day Sunday.","date":"2011-06-29 01:46:56"}

I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a \"white blonde\". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and \"medicine\" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest. So, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.","date":"2018-02-11 04:01:35"}

I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! \n\nWe first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.\n\nThe looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar\/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.\n\nWhat I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. \n\nThe attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.\n\nFive stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.","date":"2015-12-20 21:47:02"}

I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!\n\nSecondly, I love the automatic start\/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz.

The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time.

They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund, go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water.","date":"2017-08-08 02:04:44"}

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\n\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\n\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?","date":"2011-08-25 01:22:34"}

Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. \n\nOn to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup\/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).\n\nThe dessert selection was excellent. We went with the tiramisu. I understand Sapore also has an excellent cannoli which I would like to try on a future visit.

The amount of ice in it wasn't obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk.\n\nI'm coming back to try some hot coffee or espresso on a cooler day but damn Henry :((( not a great first impression.","date":"2016-08-25 15:00:59"}

Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.\n\n   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.\n\n  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?\n\nIn the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24\/7 as well! \n\nThe hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!\n\nOn our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.\n\nAt checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki.","date":"2014-08-24 23:19:52"}

We never got a confirmation email when booking over the phone. Then during the tour we had to wait and be hassled over payment that was already cleared on our account. Don't do this tour if you get carsick easily. It was full and we had to sit in the back. You can't see anything on the tour through the tinted windows and you only stop at two places that I never would have stopped at on my own. \n\nThe only intriguing part was the Katrina history during the visit the the 9th ward. Do yourself a favor and take the green street cars, save your money and REALLY see things on your own time. We couldn't get pictures of anything and wish we would have done a walking tour instead or tried the red bus tours.\n\nPLANTATION TOUR: 5 STARS! Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation. The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness) \n\nSWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold. Don't book your tour if it's cold or storming and I'm sure it will be a 5 star tour for you.

I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing.

And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \n\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\n\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \n\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable.

As my work start and end times change from day to day, though, I need a gym that has classes at various times throughout the early morning and mid to late afternoon.  I found that the class schedule here meets that need. The trainers are excellent.  The spin and row teachers are really exceptional.  Try the We-Fit class, but expect a huge challenge, even if you are fit.  The facility is very clean, but this is a new enterprise, so time will tell if the business will continue to keep things clean and fresh.  I love that the women's locker room contains a blow dryer and extra hair ties.  These little things make a huge difference. Thanks for thinking of them.","date":"2012-08-16 01:36:19"}

I am really glad I chose them.\n\nFirst off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don't mind the typical \"shop\" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.\n\nNext off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.\n\nJuan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.\n\nI got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people's standards.\n\nIt sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.  I would take my vehicles here from now on and recommend them to anyone who wants a top quality job with serious attention paid to fit and finish.","date":"2013-12-06 23:51:40"}

I really like their layout.  They have an uncrowded floor of tables and booths and a lunch counter along one side.  The counter faces the cooks' area, which I like because the bustle of multiple grills, fryers, and prep areas serves as a good distraction, not to mention you get frequent interaction with the staff.  They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.\n\nI ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.  I really have a difficult time resisting the grill.\n\nThe food was average and is what you would expect in a tourist spot in the Quarter.

My husband and I walked in without reservations during their Sunday Jazz Brunch. We waited about 40 minutes, but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied. \n\nDespite the place being ridiculously busy, our server didn't rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I've encountered. \n\nThe food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme brûlée for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. \n\nThe coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! \n\nOur bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I'm in NOLA again, I'm definitely revisiting Mr. B's.","date":"2014-01-17 03:06:58"}

My boyfriend and I went just for one night and used his AAA discount which saved us a lot. They have a parking structure attached to the hotel for $20 a night. Starting at the garage they had such cool urban art that continue throughout our stay. The check in was an easy process and the service was amazing. Everywhere you turn there is another interesting piece of art work to look at. Our room was very nice, keurig coffee machine,large luxurious shower, comfy robes, and comfortable california king. We had tickets to the Pacers game which worked out perfectly. We had drinks and dinner before the game at Plat 99 which is in the hotel- again more great decor. They had a whole timeline of cocktails and complementary truffle popcorn. (they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) Bankers Field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. After the game we came back and got some drinks at Plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. For breakfast we ate at the Market Place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.\n\nWe checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. Before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum. \n\nOverall we loved this hotel, for a quick getaway to Indianapolis, especially if you are going to a Pacers or Colts game, is was fantastic. Next time I go back to Indianapolis I will be staying here again.","date":"2014-02-05 18:17:45"}

The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.\n\nPerhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.

Should my star rating be based upon comparing Sam's to all Sports Bars in which I have ever been?  Or, should it be a comparison to Nashville Sports Bars?\n\nI chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  The sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.\n\nSam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  I really like Sam's and I really like the patio in Spring, Summer, and early Autumn.  But, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... Sam's is just mediocre.  \n\nThe service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.  I'm sorry.\n\nThe food is on the better side of bar fare.  But their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  The mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.\n\nBut, hey, it's a bar.  It has lots of TVs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. \n\nWithout even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. \n\nI used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1\/2 a breast.\n\nPlease go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food.","date":"2016-03-07 02:42:54"}

He is very friendly and fun! He did exactly like I asked. He is a very good artist. His line work is perfect and so I will be going back to him for more. I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here.

I can only speak for the manicure\/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically, you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small, dirty, and the staff is terrible. \n\nI walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water\/refreshments of any kind. I've had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn't mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow\/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don't come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. \n\nShe gave me the worst hand\/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part, and the technician's opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just \"drinking up all the lotion.\" Yes, I realize it's dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. \n\nWhen I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! \n\nOverall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn't even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here.","date":"2017-01-14 22:16:55"}

The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.\n\nMy wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.\n\nIf you're starving and want a large meal with leftovers I'd recommend other places, but if you want a satisfying meal that's an appropriate size this place is very good.","date":"2016-05-31 13:45:57"}

I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! \n\nSad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!\n\nThe patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum\na homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious.

Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the \"fanciness\" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). \n\nMy problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.\n\nI should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.\n\nFour stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.","date":"2016-06-11 21:09:53"}

I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.\n\nMBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like\/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\n\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+\/mo program.","date":"2014-01-17 17:38:39"}

However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.

Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop.

The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. \nThe decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. \n\nFree breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. \n\nCoffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24\/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say \"good morning\" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.\n\nI've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...\n\nA few things to note:\nIts location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. \n\nThere's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub\/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\n\nDon't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!\n\nOverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.","date":"2016-02-23 21:31:39"}

A cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive. I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase.

And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste, you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!\n\nI got the salted caramel banana, the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.\n\nThoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this, I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three\/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding, second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING), third layer, the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely! \n\nThe upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.\n\nDefinitely go to this place!

It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe\/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans.","date":"2012-08-14 23:10:33"}

Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.

We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming! \n\nFor apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.\n\nFor ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy\/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.\n\nNow let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.\n\nOverall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable.

They are in some sort of sweet\/sour sauce\/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.\n\nThen I had pork schnitzel and \"pommes frites\" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).

Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.\n\nWalking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.\n\nWe seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece \"jumbo\" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says \"here's your food.\" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.\n***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.\nI decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.\nWe finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.\nI got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.\n\nI got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone \"youguysdoingalright?okaycool.\" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.\n\nAnyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!\n\n2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.\n1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.","date":"2014-03-15 18:07:44"}

MexiCali has a number of great options.\n\nMany options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture, and along with the black beans, the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time, should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free, and it's another delicious, filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato, the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos, but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally, a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious. \n\nI end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back.

Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash purée and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish. The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde.

My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said.

The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My husband's \"Knuckle Sandwich\" was delicious! That is what the two stars are for. My burger was shockingly small and probably the blandest burger I have ever eaten. My son's chicken strips tasted like they floured them...and that was it... also, no hint of seasoning.

The first time I went, they had just opened. There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.\n\nThe seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's \"trifecta\" or boiling crab's, \"the whole shabang\" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.\n\nLastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common. \n\nWould recommend and go again.","date":"2017-07-18 23:04:57"}

Yuengling lager was the first beer I've ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time. Smooth, sweet, cheap, it's like me in a bottle. I love that the bottlecaps can be rusty, I like that the taste varies per batch, I even like its relatively low alcohol content. \n\nThe tour was pretty great, the British tour woman was funny in a non canned way. She took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat (signed, sports, I haven't a clue). I was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment, I could've spit in the mash and no one would've been the wiser. The whole facility reminded me of St. Pete Catholic High, 50's cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls. \n\nThe tasting, that's what you came for right? Fantastic. They were out of Lord Chesterfield, but who drinks that? I \"tasted\" the shit out of the lager, probably 6 times. It makes sense, the bar is next to the gift shop and I went a bit insane in there. \n\nThe fact that Dick Yuengling made it a point to hire back the laid off workers after the last closure bumps it up a star.

This place got the job done. Unfortunately, all the hotels in Santa Barbara are pretty freaking pricey. A lot of the other hotels started at $400+ \/night.  This ain't Vegas where you can get something pretty cushy for $250. This seemed like a decent option on the lower end. Our rooms were about $250 a night. A lot of the other hotels in the area were already booked for the weekend or required more than one night to book. \n\nPros: \n-decently priced\n-clean and cozy rooms\n-charming exterior and grounds\n-relatively comfortable beds\n-bath and body works shampoo, body wash etc\n-free water bottles and fruit waiting for you in the room\n\nCons:\n-dated decor \n-toilet issues: The hook inside kept coming undone. I guess we decided not to get maintenance because we temporarily fixed it, but it kept coming undone so it wouldn't really flush. We were checking out that day, so we decided just to deal with it. \n- door was difficult to open without using a certain technique\n-no hair dryer, so bring your own\n-no complimentary breakfast\n-a bit noisy in the morning, but I slept fine. I guess the window in the bathroom was open or something for some ventilation.\n\nOverall, I still don't think I would've chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, so BW Pepper Tree Inn was still a good choice based on the location of the bachelorette and price range.","date":"2017-05-26 06:13:56"}

Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...\n\nI step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. \n\nFirst, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there.

I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.\n\nAt around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.\n\nTHAT'S the unscrupulous part.\n\nCLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this.

Its large and clean and they seem to have a large selection of everything. But I just returned from there and have the say the customer service is lacking. I took my french bulldog in to try on some sweaters. Just to be sure I asked if it was ok to actually try stuff on and they said yes. I began looking through the selection and trying stuff on. She is very hard to fit b\/c she is short and stocky with a big head. So there I was 27 weeks pregnant with my dog, a purse and a carry cart trying to get her in and out of clothes. I was the only person in the store, while 4 people were behind the counter (and I was in plain view of them). At some point one of the cats in the store (free roaming) swatted my dog on the nose and she got away from me for a quick second. Still no one came to help. I imagine if I had asked for help someone would have appeased me but I don't think I should have had to ask in the first place. I left without buying any of the many things on my list. Very disappointed with today's visit. I expected better service and maybe that was my fault. I doubt I will be going back.","date":"2010-10-05 21:32:50"}

Thanks to Larry's Steaks, I've rekindled my passion for cheesesteaks.\n\nLarry's Steaks, situated by St. Joe's University, offers the closest thing to the original Dallesandro's cheesesteak I've found.  The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.

The girl (who seemed drunk) was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me. No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited, more loud shouty laughter.

I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich.

I had the worst experience when we went today for brunch that I've ever had in a restaurant since I moved to Tucson 7 years ago! First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like \"Oh Well.\" This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving. \n\nAt this point my friend and I recognized the danger for the two of us and asked to be moved inside to which we were told \"No.\" When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told \"Well, what did you want?\" That's when the manager came up, I explained the situation and he was going to put us at one table to which our waitress, gotten by the hostess came up and said to him \"I already to her that they could not move in here.\" What employee talks like that to their boss! The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip. I was so appalled myself, that I did not eat because I just did not want to spend my hard earn money at this establishment any longer.

I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), \na bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: \n\nThe chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. \n\nThe sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. \n\nThe mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. \n\nThe bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \n\nThe new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.","date":"2014-05-07 20:24:38"}

I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.","date":"2017-02-09 14:59:25"}

I had a coupon so I thought I would try it out. Pulling into the parking lot I noticed it was very busy. I was worried that I would have to wait a long time. I pulled up to the attendant and asked how long it would be for a reg wash. She said each wash takes about 15 minutes. I was surprised since they were busy. I left the car there and proceeded inside. \n\nThe building is huge inside. One side is all windows so you can watch your vehicle move through. They even have a \"soap gun\" the kids can use to shoot their car. That was a huge hit. \n\nThe cashier greeted me as I walked up to the counter. She took my coupon and handed me a receipt. I walked around while I was waiting. They have drinks she snacks for purchase. They sell lots of greeting cards for every occasion. They have gifts and accessories for your car. The building was cool inside which was great because it was hot the day we came in. I waited about 10 minutes and walked outside. They have a large covered area to wait under. It has some seating so you can sit and wait. After just a few minutes they yelled out my car make to say it was done. I handed the attendant my receipt and tip and I was on my way. Total time was 18 minutes which I think is fair considering they were packed when I arrived. \n\nThe car was clean and vacuumed. Overall they did a great job. The only thing they missed was the front window. It had that haze on it that you notice when the sun hits its. I wiped it off myself. I'm sure they would have fixed it if I noticed before I left. Also, they don't offer free air freshener with the wash like most other places. \n\nThis place was fast and they did a great job. The price was fair and the staff was friendly.

The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.\n\nI think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option. Their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes.\n\nI'm assuming Normand's Bistro must be connected to the Normand's restaurant which is on Jasper Avenue. Of interest, I have heard that Normand's took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the Glenora Bistro.","date":"2015-06-08 22:22:04"}

For the beer lover, however, there is a wide variety of tried and true along with the new kids on the block from local, national and international lines.

The dipping sauces that come with it are also real good, i really like the mustard base one, its kinda mustardy with a chipotle flair, and there is also a green sauce that is like a salsa.  The fries are wedge fries and they make you real full because there are plenty to go around. We had leftovers because the meal was that big.  I would rather eat here than popeyes or kfc, because you get more, its healthier, and you get better service. The owners are real nice and friendly. I will be back because I know I will be craving this chicken.","date":"2012-02-29 22:00:21"}

We did--certainly one of the \"best steaks ever\"--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.  \n   My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.

I'm far from Italian, but I can make a MEAN lasagna & spaghetti myself compared to this place. 1st of all, we waited 45mins patiently w\/ a hungry Hubby, 2yr old, 7yr old, & myself. When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good! I was still very disappointed after this restaurant was referred to me by many. I felt like they got an easy $50 bucks out of me. I would have rathered gone to the olive garden or macaroni grill. If u r looking for an awesome authentic Italian cusine restaurant in Tucson, I highly recommend Contessa off of Ina Rd.

The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. \n\nApparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.\n\nI decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.\n\nMy friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.\n\nMy boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. \n\nMy friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with lump crab meat, roasted jalapeño cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.\n\nI have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.\n\nEven with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.\n\nOne wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.\n\nAll that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.","date":"2013-05-29 14:29:00"}

I had no prior history or knowledge of jewelry, especially not engagement rings. Foolishly I visited a handful of those cookie cutter mall shops. Boring. Pricey. Nothing special. Blah.\n\nA co-worker told me about Gemological Resources Inc (GRI) and the wonderful experience he and his now wife had with them. Since it was a local shop I gave them a shot not knowing what to expect. Wow.... What a great experience! \n\nFrom the moment we (my girlfriend and I) walked into GRI, it felt right. We met with Terry initially to get a feel for GRI's work, as well as to discuss ring options.Terry is an encyclopedia of knowledge; it was a true lesson on everything we needed to know about diamonds, rings, etc. Very much worth taking the time to meet with him. He not only shared much of his knowledge, but also listened and got a good feel for what my girlfriend liked. The initial meet was a success and I felt confident that GRI would be the right place to go once I was ready to make the decisive move solo.\n\nWhen the time came I met up with GRI again, this time with Nirali who works closely with Terry. Because I wanted a unique, special, one-of-a-kind engagement ring I decided on a custom design ring. The CAD images and designs were perfect! To top it off, Nirali found me a high quality and very well priced diamond; this after I spent weeks personally searching for the right diamond. I was sold!! \n\nA reasonable deposit and a couple of weeks later the ring was finally in. Wow oh wow!! It was perfect! 100X better than anything I've seen before. GRI knocked it out of the park! Seriously! Fast forward a few months later.... My wife loves her ring and goes goo goo over it everyday. We had our bands done by GRI as well and they too are perfect (the wife's band was also custom designed to match the engagement ring).\n\nAll in all it was a GREAT outcome. We are both so very pleased and happy about our experience with GRI. Beyond our expectations. Never have I had such a relaxing and pleasant experience. I truly mean it. It always felt like I was meeting with friends and not just a standard business transaction. \n\nSo do yourself a favor... If you're reading this it's because you're thinking about buying jewelry. Save yourself the hassle. GO DIRECTLY TO GRI. I highly recommend them.","date":"2014-08-24 19:21:27"}

My daughter is now four and a half and I have a one-and-a-half-year-old son. I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant\\toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy. Are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that I do not agree with their behavior? absolutely! There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal. I try the best of my ability to not let those other children's behaviors influence my own and we talk about it. Well the best you can for a 4 year old! I really like Linda and the whole staff. She has a little turnover and I really like that. The first place that my kids were at in Carson had turn over all the time..... The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover. That's important to me that employees stick around. So, my kid has been flourishing both emotionally and academically. She's picking up things that I'm totally surprised about.... Like starfish have two stomachs and octopus have 9 brains.... I didn't believe her and I had to Google them! I didn't read the Yahoo review, but people are always going to have mixed situations with whatever's going on for them. All I know is that Linda and her daughter helped me out greatly when I was in need several years ago, and she helped me out greatly this time and it's been a great fit. I'm very happy and content.","date":"2018-10-04 13:24:36"}

I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.\n\nThe service was why I gave this restaurant 4\/5 instead of 5\/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. \n\nIn summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.","date":"2013-02-22 01:57:24"}

The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want.

I stopped into this dessert bar today to grab some dessert and a coffee to-go. While everyone seemed to be very helpful, or at least wanting to be, I'm not sure I received the best possible service. I ordered two slices of cake, one marshmallow chocolate and one cheesecake. Both were DELICIOUS, but it seemed like I waited forever to receive these, and when i did, it was in a cute but inefficient manner. The to-go boxes were stacked one on top of the other, with a loosely tied string around them. While I admire the aesthetics here, I would have much preferred a bag. Though, the worst part of my experience was the barista. I ordered an iced coffee with milk and sugar. First, he put ice in the cup and filled it halfway with coffee. He then asked me to pick and put in my own sugars from a cup of packets as he stated \"I wouldn't know what and how much you want, I only drink my coffee black.\" As I considered this incompetent statement, i expected him to then put more hot coffee in to help the sugar dissolve. But no, he proceeded to fill the rest of the HALF OF THE CUP with milk. And then handing me the drink he told me I'd better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in. Not sure why I'd paid such a high price to practically make my own half-coffee half-mild beverage, I simply smiled and walked away. I ended up throwing out the drink as I could hardly even taste the coffee and I'm not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee.

This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally, I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also, the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel.

The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter.

Anything that they don't carry can actually be ordered in for you but I have to say staff here are not always the best at phoning customers to let them know when their titles are in so one should definitely keep their number by the phone to check in with them after a week or so.\n\nThe biggest selling point for me here besides the selection has to be the staff at the tills. It can get a little busy here but lines are always dealt with quickly and I appreciate that they don't push as hard as other locations to try and sign you up for a pure card. F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great.

Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.

I've been here a couple of times, but they were the ones that wanted to go, due to their lunch special. It's a nice, well know restaurant that offers a 17.00 lunch special that includes a soup or salad, entree, and the option for a 4.00 Bloody Mary or martini. I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price. The location is spectacular, and the history behind the restaurant made for great conversation at the table.\nDefinitely check it out if you are in the Quarter!","date":"2016-01-17 14:37:44"}

And it's more than that because all proceeds support a great cause, adult literacy. Most of the books are used so donate a book and pick up a new (used) one. You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for, you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them.

As our dinner progressed it became more crowded until every seat was filled. Nice lively scene except then you can not hear squat! It made dinner conversation difficult. Boo!!!!

I was really worried as I didn't want my nails to be thin.  But I just let her do her thing.  I'm usually not picky so when she was working on my nails I didn't watch what she was doing until I realized after close examination she didn't fully take the old gel polish off.  \nNot only that, the polish didn't go on smoothly, there's are noticeable bumps on my nail bed and the sides of my nails weren't even fully covered.  \n\nI am so disappointed.  I love Young, but I don't know if I'll be going back due to my experience with my gel manicure.","date":"2017-06-06 20:04:33"}

I wonder how many people know that an Ouzaria is?  The ambience here is definitely upbeat - I'd rate it a great place for a group or first date.  They have a couple of semi-secluded tables in the back room that keeps it from getting too loud, but it's not a quiet romantic place.  \n\nWe brought my Mother-in-Law, who enjoys good food as long as it's not too weird.  I guess my wife is about the same, now that I think about it.  We tried three tapas plates; a three-cheese sampler, featuring feta, goat cheese and kasseri cheese, greek meatballs and pan-seared scallops.  We liked all three of these dishes.  The scallops were especially good - big and tender.   For tapas, they were pretty big portions, so keep this in mind.  The waitress suggested ordering one thing at a time, but we didn't heed her advice and ordered it all up front.   Two at a time would probably be a good idea.  Along with the tapas, we ordered a traditional Greek salad, which ended up being the lone clunker, surprisingly.  We just didn't like the dressing - too sweet for our tastes.  The gyro meat was fine, though, so maybe we'll just get a gyro next time.   One more thing:  The Spanish granacha (can't remember the label) was excellent for just $6 and a nice pour. \n\nOkay, now for the belly dancer:  She was cute and a good dancer, but I think this is just something that requires more alcohol on my part.  We did have a few laughs about it, though.  I opted not to get a dollar out to stuff in her skirt or whatever.   Fun but a little awkward. \n\nI've been to a few other Greek places in town that had better food, but for a night out, Momo's is definitely the choice.  We'll be back.","date":"2012-10-08 14:37:20"}

The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. \n\n2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, \"I don't know\" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.\n\n3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.\n\n4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a \"quick bite\" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.\n\nI'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.","date":"2008-04-29 20:03:45"}

I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal\/star breaker.\n\nThe service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized.

I really wanted to like it, and it has gotten so many positive reviews, so I thought it was a sure thing, but it was just a little underwhelming. Not bad, just not amazing. I had the costanza, and the fillings were tasty, but the crust was disappointing. It was way too bread-y, as opposed to doughy, and when I think of a calzone, I think of dough like pizza dough- this was not that. The calzones are a good size, but they were a little skimpy with the meat fillings. Probably the most disappointing part was the dessert- we got the apple pie calzone, and it just had a really weird spice to it- something other than cinnamon that I couldn't put my finger on. It also didn't have that many chunks of apples inside- it was almost pureed apple. Meh. \n\nI like the vibe of this place and it's close and convenient to where i live, so I really want to like it, but I just wasn't thrilled with it the first time.

But in comparing this tattoo shop to the others around Indy and how they've jacked me around i decided its simply worth it to give 5. The other places have cancelled on me at the last moment, even when i was en route to go get the tattoo, one guy didnt even remember me when i called the day before to make sure we were on schedule for the tat and yet another had the inks set out and asked me to sit down when he got a call that he needed to go pick up the kids at school - all of these places i scheduled months out in advance as well. So, here we are back at Metamorphosis where they actually like to run a business the way it should be. Honestly i have only had one tat done here by Trevor and at the time it was the most fun 4 hour rib tattoo experience i could have had. They act professional, not like the rock star wanna be's i tried to check out at other places. Just cool chill people who want your business here. Trevor gave me the tattoo i wanted in the place i wanted it even though i feel he would have given me honest advice if it were needed. When it came time to get the tat, he held his appointment and i was treated with respect and as though a customer should be treated. Honestly i dont think this place cost more than any other place where youll get good work. Prices are about average in my opinion for the quality of work done. Dont waste your time going to the other places and getting jerked around - ive already done the work for you. Its a shame too that they may have good artwork at other places but youll feel like less of a human going anywhere else. The artists are just as good here and youll be respected for your $.  And by the way, yes they do ask for a non refundable deposit so they know your serious which is no different than any tattoo place ive ever been to.\nHopefully they dont change up anything, especially their roster as i believe they have a good thing going here.

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different.","date":"2018-06-19 16:17:05"}

My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience.  Plus, the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough.  I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!!  The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time.  I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had.  I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good, however, than have someone do a half-ass job.

Coming from TN, I chose to purchase this vehicle from Glanzmann due to its limited availability and attractive price. I communicated with sales on numerous occasions before committing to purchase from Glanzmann nearly 1000 miles from home.\n\nThe process was overall quite simple, though I felt we could have gotten alot more done regarding interstate complications prior to completing travel plans to purchase the vehicle. My only actual complaint stems from the vehicle's description. As an out of state buyer, I was at the mercy of the sales team to accurately describe and depict any conditional issues that might be of interest to a prospective buyer. Unfortunately, none of the issues with this vehicle were highlighted, depicted, described, or otherwise demonstrated throughout the entire sales process. I even asked the sales agent to, while on the phone, inspect the vehicle and describe any possible imperfection so that I could have no surprises upon arrival. I spent several hundred dollars in travel expenses to collect this vehicle, only to discover there were a number of aesthetic defects that deserved attention (large dents, cracked paint, cuts in leather). I had limited time and opportunity to react to these conditional flaws and purchased the vehicle - I had already flown from Nashville to Philadelphia! \n\nThis is obviously a small family-owned dealership. I expected a considerably more honest and direct interaction and was disappointed with the outcome. The automobile is a fine machine, but the defects certainly take away from the value. Mr. Jeff Glanzmann, I implore you to make honesty your #1 policy.  I had the opportunity to purchase the same vehicle, with honestly similar defects, from a dealership in Atlanta for the same price. I opted to purchase yours, incurring not-insignificant travel expenses, because of it's immaculate description.","date":"2012-10-08 16:45:58"}

Our decision to dine here was largely based on the fact that it was pouring raining and this restaurant is next door to our hotel. We started with the bacon garlic oysters and jumbo buffalo wings. The bacon garlic oysters were average, at best. The oysters were overpowered by the cheese and bacon, which was disappointing. The buffalo wings were pretty good and seasoned well. For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of sautéed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).\n\nSo, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, was great...very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied.","date":"2017-01-02 04:29:20"}

I read so much about it on Facebook and the likes......so reading and seeing the yummy pics; well I just knew it would be all that.....untill yesterday.....\n\nMe and my bf Vince went to BlackFinn for Sunday lunch yesterday. The atmosphere was cool and it was really nice inside. The staff was pleasant as well, so I'm thinking \"hum...I like...\". We ordered  a couple of mojitos and we also had another drink, which was okay.  Time to order; I ordered the Cuban sandwich, hold the mustard, and add mayo instead....with Black Finn fries and my bf ordered the Prime Rib sandwich with au jus and the same fries.  We got our order, which took a bit of time but it was okay. Everything looked so yummy and I knew they were going to meet my expectations. Now mind ya, my bf put off going to BlackFinn since they day they opened and I've been on him to go here. So anyway, the fries were a bit salty, but good. I had a choice of two dipping sauces, which I believe were ranch and barbeque. Delicious! I bit into the sandwich and what did I taste? A mouth full of mustard!!! Eeewww!! Okay, did I not say \"hold the mustard\"? So lo and behold, my food had to be returned while my bf ate his food. His beef about his sandwich (no pun intended) was that there was more bread than meat. I looked at it and I noticed the same thing. Also, the au jus was a bit low as well and wasn't enough for the sandwich.  So I'm like the little old lady from the back-in-the-day commercials saying \"Where's the beef?\" LOL. Wow! \n\nFinally, after he finishes his sandwich, my food finally comes out and guess what? They left the swiss cheese off the sandwich. WTF! Okay, so at this point I'm like \"forget it, just take it back.\" How many times must I send my sandwich back to get it right? Now I must say that the manager on duty was accommodating and she took care of the check and apolgized for the errors. So for her professionalism and the fact that the staff was very polite, I give them two stars. Will I go back....yes I will give them another chance to redeem themselves, but all in my ear is my bf saying that there must have been a reason why he hesitated to come here and this is why.  Oh well......","date":"2012-07-17 00:38:59"}

It was such a wonderful experience! Please hear me out!\n\nMy mission on this review is to get the word out! A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls.\nWhen you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at).\nThis is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy.\nWe smoked \"sex on the beach\" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :)\nWhat I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable. Only one other couple was there and they were very nice to talk to as well. The older man and the young guy was extremely nice. The younger dude checked in on us and was sociable which was really kinda nice but not overbearing. \n\nIf you want a low key, quiet and chill hookah bar, this should be at the top of people's lists.","date":"2016-04-23 06:35:37"}

I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.","date":"2012-01-03 19:26:16"}

I wish there was a bit more ritation with the class schedule. There are classes I'd like to take but they always run mid day, never really early, after work or weekends. So no option to try them.

The batter is fine, but it gets wearing. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were definitely overcooked, which was kind of disappointing. Coke Zero on tap, but the mix could be better. For the price, it is also worth nothing there is a ton of food here, definitely quantity over quality.

Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else. Still, I threw caution to the winds of Tasker Street and put in an order.\n\nI didn't want to go for fried seafood, so the sandwiches and platters were out.\n\nI got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce ($9.50). Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.\n\nRemember when I said I didn't want anything fried, well that's not ever actually true.

Long story short, I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but \" full synthetic\". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, \"they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill\". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say \"it was good for the car and whatever\", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment, but I have the email showing what I originally asked for, so I'll be calling my bank soon.","date":"2017-08-16 09:38:12"}

Bathrooms and water park were immaculate. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. \nA star was lost because I found the water and air temp to be a tad too cold. The park was smaller then other indoor water parks I've been to. Only two big slides, one group slide, a couple of younger kids areas, lazy river and a simulated surf area. They would periodically close the big slides in order to open the surf area, for lack of staffing. A minor annoyance since that is why we were there. \nI can see how people  would be upset paying more and sharing the park with hundreds of others.

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.\n\nTheir specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!\n\nThe service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).  Can't wait to come back and try out the dinner menu.","date":"2011-02-13 20:39:21"}

Since Friendly's closed a few years ago, Warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place (DQ was our last one standing for quite some time). \n\nMuch to my dismay, the Big Scoop had already closed for the season. I marked it in my calendar go return in March, when it reopened. Upon my next trip home in the spring, I was disappointed to see that I was just a few days early for their reopening, and would have to wait until my return in April.\n\nAfter much anticipation, I made it to Big Scoop last weekend with my sister (who has been before). I was shocked to see what a range of products they serve - hot dogs, funnel cake, onion rings, pizza, you name it! I was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream, but I wasn't that hungry so I settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream. The generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough! I also tasted the birthday cake, which I enjoyed very much. \n\nThe service was quick, and the shop crowded quickly. The interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly. The man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work. \n\nEspecially given the lack of competition around here, the Big Scoop gets an easy four stars!","date":"2016-04-11 16:30:26"}

Iced coffee came out quickly and are banana bread and we went outside to sit with and realize there is no area connected to this restaurant for outdoor seating. The restaurant next-door however was not yet open so we sat at one of their tables thinking no one would mind. It would be nice if the coffee house itself had its own outdoor seating. Are iced coffee was very good and hit the spot. The vegan banana bread was good but seemed very dense to me. I'll be back another time to try some more of the fancy coffee they have available here.

The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  \n\nTheir Cuban Sandwich ($10 w\/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nI also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w\/ side, extra to add ham\/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.\n\nFor my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.\n\nOur food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.","date":"2015-03-19 04:54:53"}

I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. \n\nI'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... \n\nThe guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \n\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!","date":"2014-02-05 19:40:04"}

The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure, and when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.\n\nInside the Cake Shop will take your breath away, light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights.

The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it, but I had to because come on it's cake.

I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life. \n\nPrice: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.\n\nCustomer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet! \n\nI will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet.

I love the indoor patio dining area because it brings a bit of the outdoors in a quiet indoor setting. \n\nOn my first visit, I ordered from the dinner pre-fix menu which is a great deal (appetizer or soup + entrée + dessert = $40). The seafood gumbo soup was hearty and delicious. The dijon mustard encrusted salmon was cooked perfectly. The bread pudding was a great way to end a delicious meal.\n\nI returned to Muriel's for lunch on another NOLA trip and tried the wood grilled pork chop. The pork chop was flavorful, tender, and moist. I was not too crazy about the red beans and rice it was served with as I found it a bit bland. The entrée was served in a bowl but should perhaps be served on a plate since it was difficult to slice the pork chop since it kept sinking into the bed of red beans and rice. \n\nMuriel's is one of the places I would love to return to because of the ambiance and the great food.","date":"2015-05-26 07:29:36"}

Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)\n\nGripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \n\nGripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\n\nMajor points for:  \n*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \n*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!\n*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks\/protein bars, drinks, etc.\n*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!\n*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.\n\nI do not eat any of the hot food.

It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.","date":"2016-01-17 15:53:55"}

There is a wide variety of drink selections, and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu \n\nStarters: The New Orleans BBQ shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo. These little guys are like crack, and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce \n\nEntrees: The curried chicken salad is fantastic, though I wish they would consider serving it on different bread (it comes on two mini sandwich rolls). The BLT is also a good choice (the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious), and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying. \n\nDessert: I don't even know where to start. The Brown Shugga pie is stupid good. It never would have occurred me to order it because I don't sit around thinking about brown sugar, but a friend of mine did and I ate almost the whole thing. It's ooey, gooey, rich and delicious. The key lime pie is also a spectacular pick, as is the apple crisp. I've had almost every dessert on the menu, and not one of them has been a disappointment. The carrot cake might be one of the biggest slabs you can get in the entire United States... and it is so worth every last calorie.","date":"2015-10-17 01:28:35"}

Make it quick the food had good flavor but all was dry. The BBQ was not smoked that day. Could tell it was all reheated. Sampled all 3 bbq sauces all were good. Also ordered brisket sandwich, they have two sizes ordered the large with a side of chips wanted to sub the chips for a side they told me they don't do that.

There were some high highs and a few lows. \n\nFor the table, we started with 4 of the small plates for $16-- the hummus, the hot potatoes, the olives, and the pickles. The hummus was incredible and a really large portion. The hot potatoes had great flavor but were served in a tiny bowl-- each of us was able to only have one small bite. The olives were served warm and were quite tasty. The pickles were a-okay, but I probably would not reorder these. \n\nFor our mains, my mom and I split the trout, my husband had the roast beef sandwich, and our friend had the burger. The trout, in my opinion, was overly charred and lacked seasoning. Also, it was a whole trout, which, to be fair, is stated on the menu, but I do wish that the server or waitress would have explained a better way to debone the fish or offer to do it for us. We ended up with a weird pile of fish after we butchered it. The highlight of the trout was the potato gnocchi salad served on the side. OMG it was INCREDIBLE. I would order the subpar trout again in order to get this gnocchi side. \n\nMy husband did not like his roast beef sandwich. I think he was expecting more of a French Dip, and this was more of a cold cut sandwich. The tomato on it was mealy, and he found the onion jam to be a bit too sweet. After a few bites, he gave up and focused on his side of kale slaw, which was very tasty. (The manager did take this off the bill).\n\nThe friend had rave reviews on his burger and fries so those are a big thumbs up. \n\nThe manager came around to check on our meal, and we gave him his honest feedback. He seemed appreciative and brought out two desserts-- the brown sugar panna cotta and the peanut butter banana whoopie pies-- on the house. These desserts were definitely highlights so I would recommend saving room for the sweets at the end.\n\nService overall was fine for the first week. Some low points were that my drink (the Outsider) took 45 minutes to get to me and tasted strongly of lemon. Our waitress also took away our apps before they were finished-- this is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially because the olives, pickles, and hummus could have been used to jazz up the flavor of the trout. \n\nOverall, I'll definitely be back and look forward to them working out their opening week kinks.","date":"2015-12-20 20:49:58"}

It was really great. I had the sampler and it was amazing, especially the crawfish ettouffe ! My husband had the shrimp and grits and he loved it.

Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer","date":"2018-09-03 05:27:10"}
